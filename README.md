# dk
DK is docker compose on steroids - hence the 'Kompose'.
Also ``dc`` was already taken.

# Installation
Easy.
Clone the repo and add a symlink to /usr/bin.

``git clone https://github.com/meredrica/dk.git && cd dk && ln -s dk.sh /usr/bin/dk``

# What is this?
I hate typing so I made a few aliases at first.
But this clutters my ``.zshrc`` so I transformed it into a shell script and added it to my path.

# I found a bug
Post a PR.
This repo has exactly 3 files - you can do that.
